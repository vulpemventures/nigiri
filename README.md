## Tasting

At the moment bitcoind, liquidd and electrs are started on *regtest* network. *testnet* and *mainnet* compose files will be released soon.


*  Start nigiri:

```bash
$ ./nigiri start
```

Use the `--liquid` flag to let you do experiments with the Liquid sidechain. A liquid daemon and a block explorer are also started when passing this flag.

* Stop nigiri:

```bash
$ ./nigiri stop
```

Use the `--delete` flag to not just stop Docker containers but also to remove them and delete the config file and any new data written in volumes.


Nigiri uses the default directory `~/.nigiri` to store configuration files and docker-compose files.
To set a custom directory use the `--datadir` flag.

Run the `help` command to see the full list of available flags.

## Nutrition Facts

The [list](https://github.com/blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md) of all available endpoints can be extended with one more `POST /faucet` which expects a body `{ "address": <receiving_address> }` by enabling faucet.
