# üç£ Nigiri Bitcoin 

Nigiri provides a command line interface that manages a selection of `docker-compose` batteries included to have ready-to-use bitcoin `regtest` development environment, with a **bitcoin** node, **electrum** explorer both backend and frontend user interface. 

It offers a [JSON HTTP proxy passtrough](https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri-chopsticks) that adds to the explorer handy endpoints like `/faucet` and automatic block generation when calling the `/tx` pushing a transaction.

You can have Elements too with the `--liquid` flag.


# No time to make a Nigiri yourself?
## Pre-built binary


* Download and install `nigiri` command line interface

```
$ curl https://getnigiri.vulpem.com | bash
```

This will also install several configurable files, such as `bitcoin.conf` and `elements.conf`, that can be edited. These can be found browsing the following directory:

POSIX (Linux/BSD): `~/.nigiri`

macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Nigiri`

Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Nigiri`

Plan 9: `$home/nigiri`

* Lauch Docker daemon (Mac OSX)

```
$ open -a Docker
``` 
You may want to [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)

* Close and reopen your terminal, then start Bitcoin and Liquid

```
$ nigiri start --liquid
```
**That's it.**

Go to http://localhost:5000 for quickly inspect the Bitcoin blockchain or http://localhost:5001 for Liquid.


**Note for users of macOS Monterey an onward**

   When trying to start Nigiri, you might get an error similar to the following:

  ```bash
  Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:5000: bind: address already in use 
  exit status 1
  ```
  This is due to AirPlay Receiver using port 5000, conflicting with Esplora trying to run using the very same port. 

  There are two ways to deal with this issue:

  1) Uncheck AirPlay Receiver in `System Preferences ‚Üí Sharing ‚Üí AirPlay Receiver`
  2) Change Esplora‚Äôs port to something other than 5000. This can be done by changing it in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/vulpemventures/nigiri/blob/master/cmd/nigiri/resources/docker-compose.yml#L110) found in your data directory. If you previously tried starting Nigiri getting an error ‚Äì you might have to run `nigiri stop --delete`  before restarting it.

## Tasting

At the moment bitcoind, elements and electrs are started on *regtest* network.


### Start nigiri

```bash
$ nigiri start
```
- Use the `--liquid` flag to let you do experiments with the Liquid sidechain. A liquid daemon and a block explorer are also started when passing this flag.

- Use the `--ln` flag to start a Core Lightning node, a LND node and a Taro daemon.

### Stop nigiri

```bash
$ nigiri stop
```
Use the `--delete` flag to not just stop Docker containers but also to remove them and delete the config file and any new data written in volumes.

### Generate and send bitcoin to given address

```bash
# Bitcoin
$ nigiri faucet <bitcoin_address>
## Fund the Core Lightning node
$ nigiri faucet cln 0.01

## Fund the LND node
$ nigiri faucet lnd 0.01

# Elements
$ nigiri faucet --liquid <liquid_address>
```

### Send Liquid asset to given address
```bash
$ nigiri faucet --liquid <liquid_address> <amt> <liquid_asset>
```

### **Liquid only** Issue and send a given quantity of an asset

```bash
$ nigiri mint <liquid_address> 1000 VulpemToken VLP
```

### Broadcast a raw transaction and automatically generate a block

```bash
# Bitcoin
$ nigiri push <hex>

# Elements
$ nigiri push --liquid <hex>
```

### Check the logs of Bitcoin services

```bash
# Bitcoind
$ nigiri logs bitcoin
# Electrs
$ nigiri logs electrs
# Chopsticks
$ nigiri logs chopsticks
```

### Check the logs of Liquid services

```bash
# Elementsd
$ nigiri logs liquid
# Electrs Liquid
$ nigiri logs electrs-liquid
# Chopsticks Liquid
$ nigiri logs chopsticks-liquid
```

### Check the logs of Lightning services

```bash
# Core Lightning
$ nigiri logs cln
# LND
$ nigiri logs lnd
```

### Use the Bitcoin CLI inside the box

```bash
$ nigiri rpc getnewaddress "" "bech32"
bcrt1qsl4j5je4gu3ecjle8lckl3u8yywh8rff6xxk2r
```

### Use the Elements CLI inside the box

```bash
$ nigiri rpc --liquid getnewaddress "" "bech32"
el1qqwwx9gyrcrjrhgnrnjq9dq9t4hykmr6ela46ej63dnkdkcg8veadrvg5p0xg0zd6j3aug74cv9m4cf4jslwdqnha2w2nsg9x3
```

### Use the Core Lightning & LND CLIs inside the box

```bash
# Core Lightning
$ nigiri cln listpeers
# LND
$ nigiri lnd listpeers
# Taro
$ nigiri taro assets list
```

### Connect Core Lightning to LND

```bash
$ nigiri cln connect `nigiri lnd getinfo | jq -r .identity_pubkey`@lnd:9735
```

### Open a channel between cln and lnd

```bash
$ nigiri lnd openchannel --node_key=`nigiri cln getinfo | jq -r .id` --local_amt=100000
```


### Run in headless mode (without Esplora)
If you are looking to spin-up Nigiri in Travis or Github Action you can use the `--ci` flag.

```
$ nigiri start --ci [--liquid] [--ln]
```

### Update the docker images

```
$ nigiri update
```

Nigiri uses the default directory `~/.nigiri` to store configuration files and docker-compose files.
To set a custom directory use the `--datadir` flag.

Run the `help` command to see the full list of available flags.

## Directions

| Preparation Time: 5 min  | Cooking Difficulty: Easy |

Done! You should be able to find the binary in the local `./build` folder. Give it permission to execute and move/rename into your PATH.


* Clean

Remeber to always `clean` Nigiri before running `install` to upgrade to a new version.

```
$ make clean
```

## Nutrition Facts

`Chopsticks` service exposes on port `3000` (and on `3001` if started with `--liquid` flag) all [Esplora's available endpoints](https://github.com/blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md) and extends them with the following:


### Bitcoin & Liquid

- `POST /faucet` which expects a body `{ "address": <receiving_address> }` 
- `POST /tx` has been extended to automatically mine a block when is called.

### Liquid only

- `POST /mint` which expects a body `{"address": "ert1q90dz89u8eudeswzynl3p2jke564ejc2cnfcwuq", "quantity": 1000, "name":"VULPEM", "ticker":"VLP"}` 
- `POST /registry` to get extra info about one or more assets like `name` and `ticker` which expects a body with an array of assets `{"assets": ["2dcf5a8834645654911964ec3602426fd3b9b4017554d3f9c19403e7fc1411d3"]}`
